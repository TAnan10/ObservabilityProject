# Docker (elastic-stack-docker)
# Usually, Docker named volumes are outside the Git repo, so less to ignore here.
# If you had local files mapped into Docker that were temporary, you'd add them.
# For example, if elasticsearch_data was mapped to a subfolder:
# elastic-stack-docker/elasticsearch_data_on_host/
